What works:
Map Gen works (Random tiles, Start tiles, Goal tiles)
My player A* works
My one enemy running A* works

What doesn't work:
Second, unique enemy

Problems encountered:
Making a wrapper class
Making my own adjacent function (Wasn't hard, just figuring out I needed to was)
Getting position of player to enemy to A* to it
Figuring out state machines in Unity/C*
